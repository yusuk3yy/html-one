<h1>Favorite Childhood Memory</h1>
<p>When I was little, I used to watch these stop motion spiderman action figures. This is how I become obsessed with action figures. I remembered whenever me and my dad would go to the mall, I would also convience my dad to look around the toy stores. My dad couldn't afford any of action figures so I would act mad and distant. Now that I'm grown up I now understand why and I kinda feel bad for my dad because he tried his best to buy me cheaper toys and I'm grateful for that. Now I collect action figures and I feel good when I remember I used to dream a figure collection that are high quality. Now I have a collection of it and it feels good having those expensive figures in my hands when I remember I was just dreaming of that when I was a child.
